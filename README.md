# Cryptoverse

This app was built as part of me learning Javascript and React.

It provides basic information on the crypto market, coins and news.

The "Exchanges" section is not currently working as the corresponding API is no longer available for free.

There's no back-end code for this app as all the required data are pulled from an API.

A deployed version of the app can be found [here](https://cryptoverse-mirthis.netlify.app/).
